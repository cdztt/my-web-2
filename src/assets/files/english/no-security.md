# Li Chengpeng: Why do _ people have no sense of security?

This is one of the reasons why the _ are insecure. You lose your sense of security because you lose the *truth* in the first place. For a long time, we have been unable to have serious and valuable discussions on an issue. Instead, there is a fixed procedure: the incident broke out, and all walks of life were angry and condemned... The relevant departments expressed serious investigation and punishment, and would never cover up and condone... The truth was covered up, and reporters were driven and beaten, all kinds of deleted and posted titles... Being cleverly paced, a group of well-meaning people scolded each other as idiots, each bringing up theories and smashing a big stone in their chest... The next reincarnation.
